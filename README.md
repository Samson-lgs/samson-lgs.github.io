## Adding Your Profile Photo

To add your profile photo to the portfolio:

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Use a square image (recommended: 400x400px or higher)
   - Ensure good lighting and professional appearance
   - Save as JPG or PNG format

2. **Add the photo:**
   - Place your photo file in the same folder as `index.html`
   - Rename your photo to `profile-photo.jpg` 
   - Or update the `src` attribute in the HTML file to match your photo's filename

3. **Location in code:**
